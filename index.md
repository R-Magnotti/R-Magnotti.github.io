          <p>I am a third year PhD student in Computer Science at Rutgers University. My research is in natural language processing, planning and plan recognition in multi-modal conversational systems and speech-enabled robotic systems. Specifically I am interested in creating socially cognizant conversational agents that can make context-aware decisions to establish common ground.</p>

# **Amazon Alexa Prize TaskBot Challenge 2**
### To enable more natural dialogue in collaborative communication using Amazon Alexa.
As conversational agents become sophisticated, they are becoming more prevalent in the daily lives of people. They have the ability to help users accomplish daily tasks and help in their day-to-day lives. In this project supported by a grant through Amazon, my team and I researched the effects of implementing discourse structures on a dialogue system's ability to communicate in situated referential collaborative tasks.

# **HAICOR (Human-AI Co-Reasoning) Project**
### Humans are inherently skilled at commonsense and practical reasoning, so why aren't machines? 
Without the help of outside knowledge and machine learning techniques to help them put the information together, machines cannot currently manage this process well. My team at the University of Rochester is working on the HAICOR project has set up a system to allow machines to interact with humans and learn from them how to perform practical reasoning.

### Has Covid-19 caused you to be laid off? Look no further.
My team and I designed a web application for Yale University hackathon (YHack 2020) to match individuals looking to provide local amateur services with those looking to hire for odd-jobs.
