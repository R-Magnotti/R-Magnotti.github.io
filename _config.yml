description: As a Master's in Computer Science student at University of Rochester, I am conducting research broadly in the areas of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and AI. Specifically, I am exploring multi-step automatic commonsense reasoning of AI systems using a human-in-the-loop framework and knowledge-aware graphs. I am currently applying to PhD programs in Copmuter Science for Fall 2021 to engage in meaningful research involving AI commonsense reasoning, embodied agents, and explainable AI.
